# Network Manager Reborn
A fork of NetworkManager from NoisyFlake (retired ios tweak dev) made to work on iOS 15 and support 5G.

## Note
this tweak as of now unfortunately requires oldabi, which from what I've heard can cause instabilities.
(honestly haven't really had any on Dopamine/16.4.1 but still)

I haven't got a mac, but if anyone has a template for a Github Workflow to build using macos (which tbh
I can't be bothered to write rn) feel free to PR/contact me to have it added.
